<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’ve been working on mobile app development for four years now, while still studying at college. 
  Had my own projects, coded mostly in Java and Python, but my account on the play store got suspended, 
  for reasons I still fail to understand. But I learned a lot, both at school and while working on the apps. 
  Now I am looking to get a job with an innovative game studio, and am glad to be interviewing with you here.
  Apart from coding, I enjoy reading a good book, or a nice evening out with friends. That would do for a short introduction, 
  please tell me if you’d like me to elaborate on anything from my education, or experience with apps.</p>
